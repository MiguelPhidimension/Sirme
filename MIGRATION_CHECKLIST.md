## 📝 Notes & Considerations

### Key Differences to Remember
- Remove all `$` suffixes from Qwik hooks and handlers
- Replace `component$` with React function components
- Replace `useSignal()` with `useState()`
- Replace `useStore()` with `useState()` or context
- Replace `useTask$()` with `useEffect()`
- Replace `useResource$()` with React Query hooks

### Common Pitfalls
- Don't forget to handle component cleanup in useEffect
- Remember to add dependency arrays to useEffect
- Be careful with state updates (React batching)
- Handle async operations properly with React Query
- Test SSR removal doesn't break functionality

### Success Criteria
- [x] All existing functionality works
- [x] Performance is equal or better
- [x] Code is cleaner and more maintainable
- [ ] Tests pass with good coverage
- [ ] Team is comfortable with new architecture
